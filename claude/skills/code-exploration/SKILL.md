# Code Exploration

## TODOs

- scripts:
  - find all packages in monorepo
  - find X dep in any package deps, using `fd` and `jq`
  - find declarations

- checklist:
  - [ ] list of all packages in the monorepo
  - [ ] package relationships
  - [ ] each package's architecture + important dependencies (RN, Uniwind,
        Tanstack Query, Zustand, etc)
  - [ ] understand feature organization
    - listed all recursive dirs in `expo/**`, which is good!
      - lists all feature dir names, route dirs, and top-level dirs
  - [ ] existing UI patterns
    - 1 feature dir's files, 1 route dir's files, ALL /ui/\* component files
  - [ ] example files that were read:
    - tab route \_layout.tsx
    - features/sessions/components/session-card.tsx
    - text and input ui components
    - features/sessions/hooks/use-sessions.ts
    - constants/colors.ts

- issues with normal explorer:
  - `ls` prints permissions, my username, LOC, month/day, and file name
  - `fd` prints ENTIRE absolute path for each dir
